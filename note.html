    <p>I built this space because silence needed somewhere to go.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Unsaid</em> is not here to fix anything. It doesn’t promise closure,
      forgiveness, or relief. It exists because some words arrive too late,
      or too early, or in pieces sharp enough to cut their owner.
    </p>

    <p>This is a place to leave them anyway.</p>

    <p>
      No names are required. No explanations either. You don’t have to be brave here.
      You don’t have to be kind. You only have to be honest enough to set the weight down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some letters are love. Some are grief. Some are anger that never learned how to speak.
      All of them are allowed.
    </p>
